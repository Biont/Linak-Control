# Linak Control

This tool will enable you to control Linak-powered height-adjustable tables with a simple GUI.

Highly WIP. I will put up releases once it matures.

The tool allows you to set up a schedule for your table. It will then move up and down depending on the times and heights that you have set up.

## Usage
(Screenshots will follow)

You can up a new schedule item using the + icon on the lower right side of the screen.

A window will pop up asking you for a time and a target height.

Click save. The Schedule item will now be editable in the list.

Add new items as you wish
