# Linak-Control

This is currently highly WIP. In the future, this will be a GUI that uses
[this tool](https://github.com/ranma1988/usb2lin06-HID-in-linux-for-LINAK-Desk-Control-Cable) to control Linak-powered tables via USB.

The project is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)
